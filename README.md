## Project Description

Ecomify is an e-commerce web application, mainly focused on react js front-end development. I used SASS for styling. Also, Ecomify used Strapi as cms. Strapi is a javascript headless content management system. I integrate the Stripe payment gateway for testing purposes only. 

Ecomify has basic e-commerce functionalities such as loading products categories, loading products for each category type, user can view a single item, searching an item, relating items loading for a single item, adding to a cart, removing from a cart, updating subtotal when adding or removing items, checkout page, empty cart screen, update cart time count, etc.
